# Codebase Improvements Summary

This document highlights the key benefits of the new codebase, focusing on reduced code size, improved modularity, modern best practices, and enhanced performance based on Lighthouse metrics.

---

## Key Improvements

### 1. Reduced Code Size
- Replaced repetitive logic with reusable components and custom hooks.
- Centralized API logic and state handling.
- Eliminated boilerplate and manual data handling.

### 2. Improved Modularity
- Structured by feature: `components/`, `hooks/`, `contexts/`, `services/`.
- UI, logic, and side effects are independently maintained.
- Shared components are reused across modules.

### 3. Minimized Code Entanglement
- Prop drilling replaced with Context API.
- Clearly defined types and interfaces for component contracts.
- Functional separation between form logic, API, and UI layers.

### 4. Better Nested Code Practices
- Flat component hierarchy avoids deep nesting.
- Smart component composition keeps JSX clean and readable.
- Organized file structure improves onboarding and maintenance.

## Context API Implementation

- Replaced `sessionStorage` usage with React's built-in `Context API`.
- Centralized global state without relying on external libraries.
- Improves server-side rendering (SSR) compatibility and performance.
- Enables cleaner state access and avoids prop drilling.
- Enhances testability and flexibility in managing shared application state.

Example usage:


Removed reliance on fragile sessionStorage

Global state management using React's Context API

Enables server-side rendering compatibility and easier testing

Data remains in-memory with better performance and developer control

 React Query for Data Caching
Built-in caching avoids redundant network calls

Automatic refetch and background sync improves performance

Enhanced error, loading, and stale state handling

Reduces manual useEffect + useState boilerplate

```tsx
<AppContext.Provider value={value}>
  <App />
</AppContext.Provider>

```

# Interactive Chart Upgrade Summary

This document summarizes the migration from manually created SVG and table-based visualizations to modern chart libraries such as **ApexCharts** or **Highcharts**.

---

## Overview

The previous implementation used basic SVG elements and HTML tables for visualizing data, which lacked interactivity, scalability, and advanced visualization capabilities. The new implementation leverages **ApexCharts**/**Highcharts**, offering rich, interactive, and maintainable charts with minimal code.

---

## Key Improvements

### 1. Interactivity Features
- **Zooming & Panning**: Users can zoom into a specific data range or pan across the timeline for better focus.
- **Tooltips**: Dynamic tooltips show detailed information on hover over chart markers.
- **Legends**: Clickable legends to toggle data series visibility, making it easy to focus on specific datasets.
- **Highlight Markers**: Each event or milestone is represented as a marker with optional labels or color indicators.

### 2. Visual Enhancements
- Clean, professional appearance out-of-the-box.
- Responsive designâ€”charts scale to fit any screen/device.
- Animations and transitions enhance user experience.
- Theming and color schemes support branding or dark/light modes.

### 3. Functional Capabilities
- Dynamic data binding with real-time updates.
- Support for mixed chart types: line, area, bar, scatter, etc.
- Multiple axes support (dual Y-axis, etc.).
- Export options (PNG, PDF, SVG) for reporting.

### 4. Simplified Development
- Significantly fewer lines of code compared to manual SVG/table render logic.
- Easy configuration using declarative options (`series`, `xaxis`, `yaxis`, etc.).
- Built-in support for accessibility and keyboard navigation.

## Before vs After

| Feature                        | Manual SVG/Table      | ApexCharts / Highcharts      |
|-------------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Interactivity                 | None or minimal        | Zoom, pan, tooltips, legends  |
| Visual Markers for Events     | Hard-coded SVG points  | Dynamic markers with labels   |
| Responsiveness                | Manual sizing required | Fully responsive by default   |
| Code Complexity               | High                   | Low (config-driven)           |
| Feature Extensibility         | Limited                | Plugin & module support       |
| Export & Print Support        | None                   | Built-in                      |
| Maintenance Effort            | High                   | Low                           |

## Sample Features Now Available

- Zoom into dense data ranges using drag or scroll.
- Hover on markers to reveal the number of events and details.
- Click legend items to toggle datasets on/off.
- Visually differentiate data points by shape, color, or annotation.
- Sync charts or use range sliders for better UX in dashboards.

## Example Snippet (ApexCharts)

```tsx
<Chart
  options={{
    chart: {
      type: 'line',
      zoom: { enabled: true },
      toolbar: { show: true }
    },
    markers: {
      size: 6,
      discrete: [
        { seriesIndex: 0, dataPointIndex: 4, fillColor: '#ff4560', strokeColor: '#fff' }
      ]
    },
    legend: { show: true },
    tooltip: { enabled: true },
    xaxis: { type: 'datetime' }
  }}
  series={[
    {
      name: 'Events',
      data: eventData
    }
  ]}
  type="line"
  height={350}
/>
```
