# Codebase Improvements Summary

This document highlights the key benefits of the new codebase, focusing on reduced code size, improved modularity, modern best practices, and enhanced performance based on Lighthouse metrics.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Reduced Code Size
- Replaced repetitive logic with reusable components and custom hooks.
- Centralized API logic and state handling.
- Eliminated boilerplate and manual data handling.

### 2. Improved Modularity
- Structured by feature: `components/`, `hooks/`, `contexts/`, `services/`.
- UI, logic, and side effects are independently maintained.
- Shared components are reused across modules.

### 3. Minimized Code Entanglement
- Prop drilling replaced with Context API.
- Clearly defined types and interfaces for component contracts.
- Functional separation between form logic, API, and UI layers.

### 4. Better Nested Code Practices
- Flat component hierarchy avoids deep nesting.
- Smart component composition keeps JSX clean and readable.
- Organized file structure improves onboarding and maintenance.

## Context API Implementation

- Replaced `sessionStorage` usage with React's built-in `Context API`.
- Centralized global state without relying on external libraries.
- Improves server-side rendering (SSR) compatibility and performance.
- Enables cleaner state access and avoids prop drilling.
- Enhances testability and flexibility in managing shared application state.

Example usage:

```tsx
<AppContext.Provider value={value}>
  <App />
</AppContext.Provider>
